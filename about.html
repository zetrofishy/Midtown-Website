        </h1>

        <p>
            The main purpose of this website is to keep people updated with gaming news in a flash. I also made this website to make updates about the gaming community, and to help people know more about the Video Game they are trying to search up. More about this website is that it might not always be up to date with video games, but atleast it will still work.
