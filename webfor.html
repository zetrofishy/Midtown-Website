        <p>I made this website for a project at Midtown and I wouldnt say I just did it for the grade etc, I actually enjoyed making this website. I will try to keep this up to date with new games but the chances are really unlikely.This was a really fun project. This paragraph is to short so im wrting for to fill in. I made the website for a program called Midtown, it is a summer program that teaches kids and prepares kids for their next school year. They teach valuable values that every kid should follow. The Program teaches kids to behave well and treat others with respect.</p>
