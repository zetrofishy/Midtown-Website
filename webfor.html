        <h1>Why I made The Website</h1>
        <p>I made this website for a project at Midtown and I wouldnt say I just did it for the grade etc, I actually enjoyed making this website. I will try to keep this up to date with new games but the chances are really unlikely.This was a really fun project.</p>
