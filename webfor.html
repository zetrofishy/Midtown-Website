        <h1>Why I made The Website</h1>
        <p>I made this website for a project at Midtown and I wouldnt say I just did it for the grade etc, I actually enjoyed making this website. I will try to keep this up to date with new games but the chances are really unlikely.This was a really fun project.I also made this website to make updates about the gaming community,  and to help people know more about the Video Game they are trying to search up.  </p>
